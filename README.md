# spatial_analysis
This repository contains projects that demonstrate my spatial analysis skills. Each folder contains the data, R code, LaTex file to generate the report, and the final pdf report. The projects in each folder are described below.

**gaussian_model**

This project uses spatial gaussian regression analysis to identify the relationship between the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ), a mathematical model that predicts ozone levels, and the EPAâ€™s station measurements of ozone levels in the mid and eastern United States. Gaussian process regression is also used to predict ozone levels for other locations. This project was completed for a graduate-level statistical learning class.

**generalized_additive_model**

This project uses a generalized additive model to explain the variation in unemployment rates and finds country-level variables that significantly describe these unemployment rates. Because the response values are proportions, different generalized linear models are explored and compared to analyze the data; because unemployment rates appear to be spatially correlated, generalized additive models are also explored. This project was completed for a graduate-level generalized linear models class.
